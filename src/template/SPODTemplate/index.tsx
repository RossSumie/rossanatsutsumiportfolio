                            In 2022, the University of SÃ£o Paulo participated in
                            the SUGAR network, a global innovation initiative
                            that brings together universities and industry
                            partners to solve real-world challenges. In
                            collaboration with Trinity College Dublin and the
                            company Summit, the project focused on developing a
                            sustainable solution for urban mobility. This
                            initiative aimed to address challenges related to
                            reducing carbon emissions and encouraging more
                            sustainable commuting options. The project underwent
                            several stages of development, following design
                            thinking principles and the methodology of the ME310
                            course (Stanford), incorporating interviews,
                            personas, and prototypes.

                                            The collaboration introduced a
                                            unique urban mobility solution that
                                            focused on merging public transport
                                            with private transportation options.
                                            This innovative proposal aimed to
                                            promote a more sustainable model by
                                            integrating the benefits of public
                                            transit with personalized mobility
                                            solutions, creating a hybrid system
                                            designed to reduce urban carbon
                                            emissions and improve efficiency.
                                            This approach helped address the
                                            environmental impact of

                                    As part of the design thinking process, we
                                    began by conducting extensive interviews
                                    with a diverse group of potential users,
                                    including commuters, urban planners, and
                                    transport experts. These interviews helped
                                    us identify key pain points in urban
                                    mobility, such as inefficiency and
                                    environmental concerns. We then created
                                    detailed personas to represent different
                                    user profiles, allowing us to empathize with
                                    their unique challenges. This user-centric

                                    where we generated multiple ideas, from
                                    ride-sharing concepts to flexible
                                    transportation networks. Through iterative
                                    prototyping, we explored various solutions
                                    and received continuous feedback, leading to
                                    early prototypes that incorporated
                                    ride-sharing features.

                            emerge. The initial idea stemmed from the

                            individuals prefer private transportation despite

                            accessibility. The central question driving this
                            investigation was:

                            society, why do people still prefer and enjoy having

                            We identified three key factors in our interviews
                            and statistical analyses. The first was status,
                            linked to the car model or brand someone owns, the
                            second was privacy, and the third was route
                            customization. It became clear to our team that
                            these motivations vary depending on the country and
                            city where the solution is applied. For instance,
                            public space usage differs between Europe and South
                            America. As a result, we refined our scope, focusing
                            on mobility for commuting and other repetitive daily
                            journeys.

                            With this context, we discovered through interviews
                            that the most influential factor in an
                            individual&apos;s decision when choosing a mode of
                            transportation for commuting was the ability to
                            customize their route and get as close as possible
                            to their destination. This led us to focus on
                            ensuring that users could personalize their routes
                            on low-traffic streets, while ensuring that, in
                            high-traffic areas, our solution would behave like
                            public transport, avoiding the âaccordion effectâ on
                            traffic jams.

                            In the SPOD Connect mobility system, designed for
                            near-term implementation, users start by walking to
                            the nearest electric capsule, the SPOD. Here, they
                            receive an optimized route to their destination and
                            navigate independently to a main high-traffic route,
                            called the &quot;SPINE&quot;. On the SPINE, a driver
                            collects the SPOD, grouping it with others in a
                            coordinated, public-transport-like formation until
                            reaching the nearest drop-off point. This hybrid
                            approach blends the efficiency of public transit
                            with the flexibility of personalized, autonomous
                            mobility.

                            With advancing technology, the ultimate goal of the
                            SPOD Connect system is for all capsules to move
                            uniformly within the SPINE using coordinated
                            autonomous navigation, much like a hive. Once
                            outside high-traffic areas, the capsules would
                            regain individual autonomy. This implementation is
                            envisioned as a 30-year project, developed as a
                            forward-looking concept for the sponsoring company,
                            Summit, to adapt to future urban mobility needs and
                            evolving autonomous capabilities.
