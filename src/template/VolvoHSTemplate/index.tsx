                            In November 2023, Volvo Construction Equipment
                            (VolvoCE) brought a proposal for joint development
                            of an innovation project to the University of SÃ£o
                            Paulo and the Blekinge Institute of Technology. The
                            initial prompt was quite broad, and the only
                            specified requirement was to contribute to VolvoCE's
                            ability to implement innovative technologies in its
                            product-services. The project underwent several
                            stages of development, following design thinking
                            principles and the methodology of the ME310 course
                            (Stanford), incorporating interviews, personas, and
                            prototypes.

                                            Initially, at least 22 interviews
                                            were conducted with people who use
                                            or have daily contact with
                                            construction machinery, to identify
                                            the most pressing challenges that
                                            need to be addressed within the
                                            company's context. These interviews
                                            also helped validate whether the
                                            solution path we, as a team, were
                                            pursuing aligned with the reality of
                                            the end-users of our
                                            product-service.

                                    Next, our team created personas to personify
                                    the individuals who would benefit from our
                                    solution, representing the people who would
                                    be positively impacted by the
                                    product-service we are developing. This
                                    approach also served as a way to summarize
                                    the findings from the interviews, condensing
                                    the information into a single example for
                                    validation with VolvoCE itself.

                            and possibilities for our final solution. We started
                            with quick and simple prototypes, moved into more
                            divergent designs, and concluded with a functional
                            concept.
