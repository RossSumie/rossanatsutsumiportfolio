                            In November 2023, Volvo Construction Equipment
                            (VolvoCE) brought a proposal for joint development
                            of an innovation project to the University of SÃ£o
                            Paulo and the Blekinge Institute of Technology. The
                            initial prompt was quite broad, and the only
                            specified requirement was to contribute to
                            VolvoCE&apos;s ability to implement innovative
                            technologies in its product-services. The project
                            underwent several stages of development, following
                            design thinking principles and the methodology of
                            the ME310 course (Stanford), incorporating
                            interviews, personas, and prototypes.

                                            Initially, at least 22 interviews
                                            were conducted with people who use
                                            or have daily contact with
                                            construction machinery, to identify
                                            the most pressing challenges that
                                            need to be addressed within the
                                            company&apos;s context. These
                                            interviews also helped validate
                                            whether the solution path we, as a
                                            team, were pursuing aligned with the
                                            reality of the end-users of our
                                            product-service.

                                    solution, representing the people who would

                            contextual data. Its primary goal was to enhance
                            overall awareness of equipment health and enable
                            predictive maintenance to prevent unexpected

                            data, the solution allowed operators to function as
                            sensors, providing additional insights that could be
                            utilized by multiple stakeholders. Operators would
                            use the solution to collect data essential for
                            assessing equipment health. They would be required
                            to log their daily checkups via an app, which
                            minimized extra tasks while improving the accuracy

                            The app prompted operators to input details about
                            the machine, such as the operating environment,
                            weather conditions, and tasks to be performed.
                            Operators could also enter more specific information
                            if they observed anything unusual, like abnormal
                            vibrations, sounds, or odors. This feature remained
                            available at all times to ensure that any new
                            symptoms were promptly documented and included in
                            the report. Additionally, operators were asked to
                            take pictures throughout the checkup as a security
                            measure, verifying that the inspection had been
                            completed. These images were stored for future
                            reference and analyzed for any visible issues the
                            operator might have missed.

                            machine&apos;s existing data to update the virtual
                            model. By employing ML algorithms, prediction models
                            are developed to anticipate future failures. These
                            models would take into account various factors such
                            as the type of machine, the nature of the task,
                            environmental conditions, and the machine&apos;s
                            historical data. By analyzing this combined data,
                            the ML model can recognize patterns and trends that
                            aid in predicting potential failures and issues in
                            the future. This proactive approach helps in
                            preventing potential downtime and ensuring smooth
                            operations.
